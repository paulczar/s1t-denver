# Spring One Tour - Denver - Open Spaces

## Rules of Open Space

1. Whoever comes is the right people
2. Whatever happens is the only thing that could have
3. Whenever it starts its the right time
4. When it’s over, it’s over

## Process 

1. First we brainstorm sessions by forming a line on the side of the stage
2. Attendees write the topic themselves so you can go through topics faster
3. Vote on topics
4. Arrange topics in timeline / spaces

|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2:45 | | | | |
